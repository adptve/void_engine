Fix needed in command.cpp:

Line 223: Change
    CommandId id = next_id_++;
To:
    CommandId id{next_id_++};

Line 285: Change
    if (id == 0) {
To:
    if (!id) {

Line 351: Change
    return it != name_to_id_.end() ? it->second : 0;
To:
    return it != name_to_id_.end() ? it->second : CommandId{};
